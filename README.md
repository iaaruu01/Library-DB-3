## 9. Count of loans per book title 
  --> SELECT Title, COUNT(MemberID) AS total_ID

      ORDER BY Title ASC;

      
## 10. Select staff names with CategoryID 'between' 1 and 5

----> SELECT BookID 
      FROM loan 
      WHERE LoanDate >= "2025-01-01" `AND` LoanDate <= "2025-05-30" 
      ORDER BY MemberID DESC;
